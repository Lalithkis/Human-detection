##Autonomous Search and Rescue Drone

#Overview
Search and rescue operations in remote and challenging environments often face significant delays due 
to difficult terrain, poor visibility, and limited accessibility. Traditional methods, such as manual search 
teams and helicopters, require extensive time, manpower, and resources, which can reduce the chances 
of survival for missing individuals.

#Project Objective
To overcome these challenges, this project focuses on developing an 
autonomous drone-based system integrated with machine learning for real-time person detection and 
location tracking.

#Key Features
- YOLO (You Only Look Once) for Object Detection: Enables quick and 
accurate identification of missing persons.
- Real-Time Location Tracking: Transmits the exact location of detected individuals to the rescue team.
- Autonomous Navigation: Allows the drone to operate efficiently in challenging terrains with minimal human intervention.
- Enhanced Detection Accuracy: The YOLO model is trained on a dataset containing various human postures and environmental conditions.
- Search Grid and Manual Control: The drone autonomously navigates pre-defined search grids or responds to manual commands for specific areas.
- Cloud & Local Server Integration: When a person is detected, the system extracts their coordinates and sends the information to a cloud or local server.
- Rescue Team Communication: The server forwards the extracted coordinates to the rescue team via a mobile application or SMS.

#Impact
This solution enhances the efficiency and speed of search and rescue operations, ultimately saving lives.
